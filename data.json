        "REVIEW": "my son loves it \n This article arrived in the states, some letters do not work on the keyboard, says that it has a 90 day Warranty and is false. In less than 60 you can not do anything. It is a Deception. \n Buen servicio \n Great buy no issues will buy from them again \n It came in good condition and worked very good \n Brand NEW phone with no scratches and everything works! I couldn't be more happier! \n Works great! There have been no problems with it! \n It is a fine product so far. \n Do not purchase this. I received it completely dead which is no problem I had read that other people were having the same issues. So I charged it and wouldn't turn on, I used all the iPhone tricks to turn it on and nothing. I took it to Verizon to see what kind of trade in I coikr get cuz I just needed a phone and when she started entering the info of iPhone into the computer she said that it isn't compatible with Verizon like it was advertised. So just a heads up don't throw $188.00 in the trash like I ended up doing. \n i will never ever pay from then. when i got it the phone wouldn't work and when i got it to work finally it shut down. plz don't get this phone and save your money and time",

        "REVIEW": "I got this today, it came in good packaging with a charger  it is flawless like new and works great. \n The iPhone 5s was in excellent condition when I had recieved it, along with the charger. There were no scratches or significant markings. I did not recieve any headphones with the package, which is not an issue with me since don't like apple ear buds anyway. I had no issues having the SIM card inserted in my phone through my carrier. \n My daughter loved her new phone and i was able to switch it over to our carrier. No dings or dents. She is enjoying it \n Zero stars! This phone is garbage. It doesn't charge, the message \"this accessory may not be supported\" pops up every time I plug it in. It took 24hrs to get from 39% to 74% on the charger it came with. Brand new chargers don't even work. This is the worst. \n I bought this for my husband who is really hard on phones, even with an otterbox.  lol.  It works really well. \n This iPhone is as expected and in good condition \n Vw\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb \n great deal \n Perfect perfect shape is working fine I love it thank you \n Wonderful condition and works like a charm.",

Yea so it's been about a year since I bought this. The battery is still pretty good and I didn't have a problem with it in the northeast winter. It's been a reliable phone and is compatible with my crappy Straight Talk plan. \n Works perfectly! Came in a day early! So very pleased with this phone! \n I would like to have this item back i didn't mean to return. \n I love my phone it's everything it says it going to be \n Came on time but the battery is going bad \n Phone over heats  and dies too quickly. I would recommend anyone to buy it. \n This phone completely died after 2 months of use!! The return window has closed and I hope Amazon will make good on this when I submit a request for refund.

        "REVIEW": "The phone wouldn't hold a charge. \n My son loves this phone \n Great quality. It's like a new iPhone \n The phone was in EXCELLENT condition, unlocked and I had no problem getting it activated through Metro PCS.  However, I have only had the phone for 2 weeks (I received it March 2, 2017)and with minimal usuage, my battery does not last. It will jump from 50% to 20% and down to 5%. It's been over heating, it will randomly shut off and I have to charge it at least 4 times a day. I will be RETURNING this device!!!! \n Yes very happy \n Love my phone thanks \n It came basically brand new looking thats the only reason i gave it 3 stars and also it works fine so far. The reason i regret buying is because the charger is a cheap and not the real or official Apple charger which i will have to purchase now for like 30 bucks it takes about 6 hours for a full charge and dies quickly even when i don't use it i have to charge it twice or three times a day. \n I have metro and they sell the phone for $150 i feel stupid for not just buying it straight from them because they would of gave me the official charger and not some cheap 3 dollar charger. I would return it but im too lazy \n Very happy with the iPhone. Great price and it's like brand new. Would definitely do business with again.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \n Very good overall. Worth the price, however there are some things that could be better. So this is an in depth review of this refurbished iPhone 5S sold by Luuki_Luuki \n 1. Overall Phone Condition: \n Like Brand New. Any other comments wont be necessary. This phone looks and feels like brand new. Cosmetically its 10/10. \n 2. Packaging: \n Cheap. As you'd expect, this phone comes in a cheap aftermarket Chinese box, it looks OK, but far from high quality. \n 3. Accessories: \n 1 out of 5. Very very cheap charger, I wouldn't use that charger with my enemy's iPhone. Cable? Its OK but extremely short, probably 2 ft long. \n At this point I believe I purchased just a phone, accessories need to be purchased separately, since the ones that came with it are useless. However, phone looks great and works perfect. Phone costs 185$ which is not bad for a like new phone but make sure you spend another 30$ on a nice charger and cable for it. \n There was a screen defect.",

She lives in the same area as my son. So he's her techie. It calls well can't say much on other functions as texting is beyond her grasp God bless her! \n Ordered 2 of these refurbished Iphones for my sons. Its been a week and so far so good. No problems. I will update this review if we come across any issues. Knock on wood, but there is a warrantly. \n Only 2 months after the purchase the wi-fi signal turn gray and never returned. And the camera simply does not work. Shame! \n Good afternoon. Nice to meet you. \n Very unhappy, by the blow that the phone has in a corner, very ugly. When I'm buying a new phone, and I see this ugly detail. How bad that from Venezuela, you can not send to the USA. \n What displeasure. I do not recommend them. \n I like it. \n The phone would not keep charge. I had to buy a battery. \n The cable charger didn't work, I have to purchase one. \n Not sure if these are best phones.

        "REVIEW": "Works well great for the price \n Phone has a problem! \n Excellent refurbished Iphone. No problems at all. \n Is great as a phone, with a new updates from apple sorry that I purchase in a price and days later was less expensive of the price I paid \n So far so good. Always skeptical when making a \"big\" purchase. My old iphone was having no service issues randomly dropping. This seems to be working, will update if it fails. Slight dent in one corner of the phone otherwise it looks pretty much new. Way better than buying from the retailer where they only sell the newest and best phones for half a grand. I went with this instead of Gazelle because this has a 90 day warranty on it I think Gazelle only has 30. Plus Gazelle makes you pay more for \"fair, good or excellent\" quality. I think this one you just pay one price and get a decent phone. Could be a crap shoot though but I would say mine is somewhere between good and excellent condition. I would use this again instead of buying a new phone for 3x the price. \n The phone that I receive had visible scratch and dents, I just send it back. \n Phone arrived tonight. Phone came with charger will not come on at all. \n The phone arrived even earlier than predicted. I waited over a month to write a review in case it started acting up, but so far it has been working great! The Touch ID feature works well and I have not had issues with this device. The only complaint I have is that it didn't come with the little metal piece to open the SIM card holder. A thin enough paper clip worked as a substitute though. \n I was very scared before purchasing but I have to honestly say they proved me wrong. Item arrived on time and is in new condition! And works really well thanks !!! \n This product says that it is GSM unlocked and my phone company doesn't recognize the imei",

        "REVIEW": "Good iPhone. \n battery kept shorting, (died @ 40%) missed very important meeting b/c of this silly refurbished junk. \n I received the phone fairly quickly. It came with a few starches but I just over looked as they were minor. After about 1 week of having the phone the bugs begin. My home button would stop working and the screen would freeze. I would have to restart the phone in order to get it to work properly. I ignored it in the beginning however, it got worst as time went on. A couple weeks ago the phone started shutting off & on, on its own until about a week ago when it completely crashed & no longer came on. So I have since returned the phone & won't repurchase. \n Good Stuff!!! \n The phone was in good condition when  received its been working fine ever since i have had it for about a week now.

I didn't realize that it wouldn't have a sim card and she wouldn't be able to use it without one. Luckily, I had a friend who had an extra sim card and let us have it. Overall, it's an iphone and we love our Apple products! \n My daughter loves her phone. The price was affordable. I was impressed because the phone looked new. We didn't have any issues activating the phone. \n works fine. \n This phone is defective, after two days the charger stopped working, I used a back up charger and the does not work anymore, it chargers to 1% and that is it, these people are professional scam artists, I will be returning this item immediately for a full refund. Do not buy from this person, you will regret it. Very disappointed!!!! \n Good job \n Missing ear buds and the key \n Came in very good condition looks like its new and functions very well \n Evely thing perfect. \n My IPhone arrived in a short time in great condition and is working fine.

        "REVIEW": "The phone came with a dis-functional home button (the button you use the most). Right after I bought it I had to travel so I had no choice to return the item.  However this is a mal-functioning phone so I am not sure if the certification as the state is really true. \n Disappointing. \n 5S was pristine on the outside and we have not had any issues in the few days it's been in use.  Came with charger and cable that seem to be the genuine items. \n I am a 75 year old whose flip phone served her well but was on its last leg and the charger was also becoming unreliable.  Husband and daughters maintained that it was time that one of the two of us needed to update and it was going to be me.  I have two Nanos, one iPad Mini and an iPod Touch so there was no question I would go with an iPhone.  The question was when and my husband pushed for Christmas (2016).  I started doing research right after Thanksgiving but then put it off until I ordered everyone's Christmas presents.  After a week's time devoted to family's gifts, I had to start all over again finding an available Certified Refurbished 5S 16GB GSM Unlocked iPhone within my price range from a very reputable dealer.  I read reviews until my eyes were crossed and TECHarvard filled the bill.  In less than a week it was on my doorstep and it looked like new.  It has performed beautifully and I am thrilled to have made the decision both to buy an iPhone and to have purchased it from TECHarvard.  I will certainly not only recommend this firm but will be purchasing from them in the future.  They assured me that should I need any help or information, I need only contact their customer service.  Certified Refurbished on Amazon is the additional guarantee of quality. \n The phone is great! \n Working great \n still works !! \n Phone was in 'like-new' condition upon receipt and has performed similarly. \n Pretty sure this is the Chinese version of the phone. \n Horrible....

The plug is there,  no cord.  Very disappointed my daughter can't enjoy her big present without me having to go to the store for another. \n This refurbished cell phone does not work. \n Not a good purchase!  After 2 months of little wear/tear the screen is not responding at times for 2-5 min durations and it is nearly impossible to talk with someone on the phone because they cNt hear me.  The phone has had a protective cover and shatter glass installed since it was opened.  Not good.  Feel like I bought a \"lemon\" and it was only a matter of time before it was going to fail.  Very disappointed!!! \n I purchased this as a gift and received it yesterday. Phone was is an excellent shape. However, it did not come with any of its normal charging accessories(cable and adapter) or the apple headphones. Came in a little ziplock inside a generic white box. Little disappointed in that it doesn't quite round up as a gift. \n The order arrived quickly, and in excellent packaging with no damage. I've since been using the phone for several months and have had no issues even after several nasty drops. Completely as advertised \n One thing to note, the product I received does not include an option to turn off shutter noise when taking photos, thus the reason for deducting a star. \n Waste of buying phone didnt even last a good two months before it started giving me problems. \n Reading some of the other reviews I was a bit worried that I might receive a phone that was beat up and just not up to par with what should be certified refurbished. I was pleasantly surprised when I received a phone that was practically brand new! I installed my old SIM card and was up and running within minutes.

I tried muting the phone (it did, but the shutter sound persists), doing reset by pressing the home bottom and off buttons, changing the volume to min. It seems to be a defect. \n So glad we made the step into the IPhone world- these phones work amazing and quickly!  Loving everything about it- especially the fingerprint reader!  Easy to handle, decent in size, quality screen and a very nice camera as well!  Can't think of any issues I've had with it except that I hadn't found one sooner! \n Product was suppose to look and work like new. CERTIFIED???This Apple didnt work from the begining. It restarted constantly and has a bug...Where is the refurbished certified?? Its a SHAME!!!! i WANT TO CONTACT YOU TO BE REFOUND. \n Product is not truly unlocked as described in ad and does not have a 90 day warranty, it only has a 30 day warranty. I'm stuck with a phone I can't use because if this false description. Not a happy customer. \n I bought this phone refurbished and I love it. I've had absolutely no issues with the phone and it does everything I need.  Sure, the latest and greatest iPhone has a better camera, etc., but for around $200 I can live with the savings and a few less features.  I had no issues setting it up and  replacing my iPhone 4s with my current AT&T plan. \n Exactly as described received quickly \n This phone we received was in excellent condition and works very well.  No complaints.  I was a bit apprehensive about buying a used phone sight unseen.

I received my phone 11/12/2016 and it is dead, zero, not working. I put my phone on charge \n last night 11/22/2016 and this morning at 5:30p zero, dead, not charged!! It has worked all of 10 days. I will ask for a full refund. I even put it on \n the car charger because I thought well maybe Amazon sent me on of those chargers that were reported defected, but it did not charge on the \n car charger either.  Now over the holiday when family members are texting and calling I am totally out of the loop!!!!  This is unbelievable! \n Not in good condition . Button of on the top does'nt work . I keep it I have all in my phone :( \n So far no problems.  I was worried about buying a refurbished phone, but I saved a lot of money and its as good as new. \n This phone was fantastic and in mint condition.  We had absolutely no issues with it for the short time we were actually able to use it.  We switched cell phone carriers, so my daughter could no longer use this phone because it's not compatible with Verizon, otherwise, she'd still have her face glued to this one instead of the one we had to switch to. :) \n This is the second phone I bought here, I didn't had any issuewith the first one, it was in a pretty good condition, but this time I am very dissapointed, the phone is in very poor condition, full of scrapes, as if it had fallen many times without case protection. \n It certainly  did sufficeverything what I needed.  We had  some difficulties  and the representatives  did a great job in waiving  my fee  when product was delayed  in order to get it here on time. \n Great buy \n ok \n Perfect !",

I would very much recommend purchasing this if you are looking for an iPhone at a low cost. \n Its ok. wasn't as big of an improvement over my old worn out 4S as I thought it would be. it occasionally freezes or has slow response. I'll probably buy another apple whenever i'm ready to upgrade this one. \n The phone was in good condition and the wife liked it much better than the Samsung she was using \n very good \n Seller's description is totally off since the phone is not refurbished at all; really  rough edges, glass screen is off the casing, phone excessively  warms up while charging which is clear indication that battery was not replaced.Amazon shouldn't be endorsing this seller if they don't make a better effort to sell a product that is accurate to the description been advertised.

I was actually happy since I had wanted an iPhone 5 for a while. It was easy to connect it to my phone service and this summer, when I traveled in Europe, it worked with the various SIM cards I bought there. My friend's, supposedly unlocked iPhone 5, would not accept the European SIM cards. Love my i5! \n Great Phone. Arrived on time and works well. I bought this phone for my partner and he loves it.

        "REVIEW": "A refurbished iPhone 5S is an excellent opportunity to get an apple device at a significant discount. The Amazon Certified Refurbished device performs exactly like a device purchased directly from Apple would, however it is worth noting that there are no headphones provided, and the charging adapter and cable are both third party and much lower quality than official charging devices from Apple. \n No issues after months of use. Would buy again. \n Very good phone, it looks like new! \n Touch screen was always buggy, working off and on very  from the start (but becoming a problem about a month later, when it was too late to return it). Now screen is completely dead. Disappointing. Would not buy this phone. \n The iPhone 5S is great. \n Love the phone and it came on time. But it came with a non apple charger and no headphones. I'm afraid to use the charger. Luckily I had an apple charger that I can use and will buy another apple charger soon as a back up. \n Really bad, the accessories didn't work at all. The conditions of the device were quite worse than I expected. \n I bought this iPhone 5S 16GB for my daughter and she loves it. The screen is picture perfect clear.

I was pleased with the purchase and I thought she would be as well. I sent it to her and when she went to get it activated she turned it on and the screen was just pink.

        "REVIEW": "WORST EXPERIENCE EVER WITH AMAZON. If I could give a zero star rating that is what I would give because this phone, an iphone 5S, worked for about 8 months and that was it. One of the microchips was defective. Not worth repairing. $300 in the rubbish. HOW DARE YOU DO THIS TO THE PUBLIC???? \n Doesnt work ... Im waiting 2 week for my refound \n This piece is defective. I got checked in Apple Store also. Audio is not working. As per apple store, i cannot insert ear plugs as some other metal piece is inside which is struck. I am really frustrated with the service provided. I never expected Amazon to send me a defective piece. This is totally frustrating. \n Thank you \n Bought this phone in June and its only two months and the phone keeps shutting down. I am not sure what is wrong with it but I feel like I wasted my money \n Great condition, good battery, works like it should \n \"I was very skeptical at first buying a phone online but I've had it for maybe 5 months now and it doesn't even seem used, scratch free and the battery life is normal and my phone doesn't act up in any way. Seems no different then buying a new one from the phone store honestly.\" That's what I said before I realized I only have 11.5 GB. I now have to keep deleting stuff and I don't have much but music. Before I downloaded more music it was perfectly fine. Sucks I don't have the full 16 tho \n Excellent, no problems at all after 3 months use \n Phone looked brand new! No scratches on screen or outside of phone. First time buying a refurbished product and I highly recommend. \n I love the phone! Its perfect and so far it doesn't seem fake, but I had 2 day shipping and it came in 5 days which disappointed me.",

        "REVIEW": "Horrible!!! The item arrived defective. It was giving a blue screen every two minutes restarting itself on his own. It keeps acting like this in a loop for more than 5 minutes and keeps doing. Starts showing the apple sign then goes to the blue screen over and over. \n good work i love it \n The phone shuts off randomly as and when it feels like it. Camera is terrible quality, and it overheats. I know it's a refurb and I shouldn't expect much but this is disappointing. It shut off even during the setup process. Simple processes like multitasking, switching between apps- and God forbid using Snapchat- are way too much for this phone to bear. it just goes comatose and refuses to come on for at least 20 minutes. The screen has also randomly turned red/gray on occasion, and then shut off. \n Additionally, the display can stay on for hours and refuse to sleep, even when set to dim/sleep after 30 seconds. It does this on random days. \n Overall, this is less than stellar. \n Ok todo muy bien \n This cell phone has only 3 months and is having a lot of problems already. It rans out of batery in 5h and the seller never reply to my complains! \n ty \n I like it \n excellent deal for me \n Recomendable excelente producto \n This phone works great I'm glad I got it",

        "REVIEW": "Product was fine until the screen started flickering and completely stopped working 3 months later. I've had it in a protective case and every thing. Don't buy refurbished, because you're screwed when this happens! Just invest in buying one from Apple! \n Compact and simple to use.  I wanted a smaller phone with lots of functionality and this fits the bill perfectly. \n I needed an unlocked phone for when I was moving to Australia from America and so I bought this one. It came just like new (like they said). I was a little worried about it being a refurbished phone, but it works great. My only complaint is it doesn't come with the latest update, and for some reason sometimes the newest updates of iOS can sometimes make \"older\" iPhones not work well. So I've been a little weary of updating it, but that's not really the problem of the sellers. Anyway overall a great buy and would definitely recommend! \n I love the phone it's works great with metro , Nor is there nothing wrong with it \n I bought this iPhone as a gift for my daughter & she loves it!!! \n Crear! \n Working good \n I love it!

This is a great deal for so cheap! People should be more grateful. My phone is honestly brand new, works perfectly, I fell in love at first sight. I will always recommend this seller and I will buy from them in the future! It arrived on time, and I live in the Caribbean so shipping usually takes two weeks but it took 5 days for it to arrive! I was surprised. Fastest shipping. Great service. However; please know that there's minor scratches. But who cares? It's minor because you can hardly see. I didn't notice until I stared really really well, so no worries. Put a case on and you'd be fine!

But I ordered this (live in NYC) and I got it the same day with Same Delivery (extra $10 but was worth it). Product came in perfect condition other than one little scratch ( it was VERY small you could barely see it ). Only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 was I didn't know you needed a SIM to activate the phone. It wasn't a problem though I went over to my friend's house who let me borrow his used SIM for like a minute so I can activate my phone. Great product, great price, get it still while you can! \n It is very good overall, but it appears to have japanese parts, because the camera shutter sound coud not be stopped by any means which is stupid \n Speedy ,",

        "REVIEW": "The phone is great but the charger stopes working after 2 days \n I purchased my phone from BuySPRY. I think some of the negative reviews I have read are directed towards the seller yet the seller was not mentioned in the review so I thought it would be worth mentioning who I purchased from. \n The phone I received is in perfect condition. Looks brand new. The phone was indeed unlocked and very simple to set up. It came with charging cable and USB to AC adapter, but no headphones. The first thing I did was test the battery life as that is probably the biggest complaint on refurbished phones. The batter charged fine and has been holding its charge without issue. Everything on the phone works perfectly, I am very happy with the purchase. \n Excellent phone! Looks very new!! Very happy happy happy. Gave seller name to friends so they can buy from them also! \n e \n Se apaga \n son loves it \n Great deal. It was a great deal. Only problem was the charging cable that during charging the screen stop working but I was lucky to have the the original cable. \n The phone exceeded what I was expecting . Its a refurb but you cant tell by looking at it . I was up and running in no time . This is the second one that I purchased . So far i'm a happy customer . \n It's ok.- \n Very good",

        "REVIEW": "Exactly as expected (In a good way) \n Great for the price \n It was in good condition. Overall I was happy with the product. \n Came in brand new with charger which was nice but only giving it 4 stars since no earphones came with it \n Battery charge running out in 2 hours \n It was packaged very poorly for shipping. It was put in a small box inside a much larger box with nothing in there to cushion it. The small box holding the phone did not stay closed so the phone was loose and banged around inside the much larger box. The battery dies VERY fast and sometimes won't charge. I have to reboot the phone for it to show as charging. If the charger is disconnected and then reconnected, the phone has to be rebooted again for it to continue charging. Also, the charging cord that came with it did not work at all, I had to buy a new one. This phone was a huge waste of money. \n It is a good product but, it could be better. It doesn't come with original accessories, neither the original box but, the cellphone was in a good status  and functional. \n i get the phone.. works perfect look good but a tiny detail on the back... not  big deal but.. when it comes to the camera. there is no way to turn off the shutter sound  even using the silent mode... after some research i found is a Japanese version of the phone and there is illegal to turn off the shutter noise ! \n Everything was amazing about this phone! It works great and looks nice! This Is my first iPhone I went from android. Gotta say I like apple a whole lot better! Shipping was fast. \n Love it.",

        "REVIEW": "Very good quality of this refurbished product and very good support from Breed. Looks like a new device. \n So far so good everything is great and my phone has 0 scratches. I was pretty skeptical before because there are such bad reviews and maybe I got lucky but I'm really happy with my phone. Just one bad thing is that pictures make that clicking noise when you take them even when your phone is on vibrate. Looking to get it fixed if the company would be nice enough to take money off so I could get it done. I've had this phone for about a week and my phone froze for a few hours until I pressed the home key and the lock screen button at the same time. Works perfectly again love it \n Perfect phone, fast delivery, happy customer! \n So far so good! Havent used it a lot but i tested it for a day so it worked fine. Its send overseas as a gift \n The phone looks brand new, however it did not come with the tool needed to insert the sim card. \n I liked that the phone and charger was included.I didn't like that no earbuds was with IPhone. \n the phone is like brand new  loved it \n i love my new iphone \n A refurb phone for half the price. A good deal. I wanted the 5S because it's smaller. and I wanted an unlocked phone because I would be travelling abroad and wanted to get my own Sim cards and carriers.  The phone works fine except for one thing: the wifi radio is not as strong as it should be. I need to be much closer to the base unit than anyone else. Maybe that's why this unit was returned? Is this a deal-breaker? No. Still happy with it and still got a good deal on it \n Phone came exactly as advertised, charging cable and wall wart were included.  Just a heads up it does not come with headphones.  But for a seemingly brand new 5s for so cheap you really can't go wrong.",

        "REVIEW": "Everything was as expected. \n Exelente \n After reading reviews on other websites about refurbished phones I knew the best place to go was Amazon.  And Amazon came through for me offering this great refurbished phone along that this seller was certified to do quality work in refurbishing phones.  I have wanted an I phone for a long time aqnd the price of this phone can not be beat.  I had no problems with the phone, and It was unlocked just as they said.  It does not come with an instruction book so I watched how to set it up on UTube.and it made my eyes cross.  At this point I have to admit I am a sweet little old lady (at least I think I am) and going from android phones and tablets was a little unnerving.  I was so afraid I would set something up wrong.  and I did.  but eventually I realized my mistake.  I have 3 rotten middle age kids who just howled with laughter when I tried to get help from them.  But I showed them .... I am now using it with confidence (well almost).  I would recommend these refurbished phones to everyone.  This is a safe place to purchase them and that is important to know.. \n Apple iPhone 5S 16GB Factory Unlocked Smartphone, Gold (Certified Refurbished) \n Great! \n There is a pulsing humming sound at times.  I've never heard this sound of any of my other iPhones... \n I have always been an iPhone fun. I like them a lot now i have one for work and personal use. You will never go wrong with an iPhone \n Everything works \n Sorry to say, the  battery in this s5 IPhone was bad , from factory. Other than that hasn't had any problems. What can I do about getting another battery. \n Despite some initial set up problems (which were the consequence of Apple requiring an iTunes connection to do a total reset), I was happy with this purchase, including the fact that Prime Mobility would have been willing to accept a return with no complications if it had been necessary. It wasn't. The phone was in excellent condition, and is working well. \n This phone was in EXCELLENT CONDITION, LIKE BRAND NEW have not had any problems with the phone and it was UNLOCKED as it stated...my daughter LOVES HER IPHONE",

        "REVIEW": "I really like this phone! I got it to transfer my Tracfone number to a nice smartphone. It works great! The transfer was easy and I keep up with minutes through the Tracfone app. I love the fingerprint recognition instead of a password. Feel like I've finally joined the 21st century! \n Bought this refurbished phone, it come and it was dead :( \n I was a little jumpy about getting this because of the negative reviews but this phone works perfectly and was in perfect conditon physically. Works with GSM carriers as said and I activated it with MetroPCS \n Exactly as advertised. No complaints at all. \n Great \n I have to say I was a bit nervous about purchasing a refurbished phone. Especially an older version of a phone, but this has way exceeded my expectations! The shipping was super fast with Prime, and it came exactly as described. I have been a die-hard Samsung fan since the galaxy 3 came out; I have to say I have converted my thoughts to being more of a fan of the iPhone now. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who is looking for an IPhone at a cheaper price and doesn't care about the box that it comes in. \n Good \n This was a used phone but it looks and functions like new.

        "REVIEW": "Great product. But we bought it as a gift and the case was scuffed up so that was not cool.  Otherwise your good to go on this purchase. \n Good! \n At first everything worked like it should've, it glitches to this blue screen a couple times. I had the iPhone for less 2 months and the blue screen popped again and usually I can just shut it down and back up and it would work. but this time was different I tried to do that, but  it just died. Doesn't work at all and I can't refund it \n This was such a great work around for me.  The refurbished phone is perfect. It cost me less than a repair and seller had in my hands sooner than I even expected. \n Good product, looks new. low cost. Worth buying. \n The phone was delivered as scheduled.  It came in brand new condition, minus a few MINOR scratches.  It was unlocked, as described, and we were able to have it activated the same day that it was delivered.  My son is extremely happy. \n Very disappointed. My headphones won't even connect into the port. I tried several headphones that all fit into my 6s and even tried in my old 4s. The port is just too small for some odd reason. Also, the volume turns down automatically to the lowest volume level almost every time I'm on a call. It started doing this about a couple weeks after the 30 day return policy. I'm pretty upset as this phone is supposed to be a replacement for my old 5s business phone that was stolen in Peru. Now I'm stuck with it...$200 later \n very disappointed,  It  works good the first month them I  couldn't get it to charge.  I dont \n Really good iphone. Well packaged too.

Great battery and never had had an issue with it. Wanted to write a review way after to make sure it works. I will buy from BREED again. \n The phone is great (I'm using it right know) but they gave me the wrong color which is no big deal. Also the phone doesn't come with a SD card (I think that's the name) so you have to have one to put into the phone. There also wasn't a long wait which is good! \n Got this for my moms birthday. It was fantastic a few dinks here and there but barely noticeable she loves it and that's all that matters \n I've never had an iphone before and I wanted to try it out.. I am so glad I did! I am now converted to iphones! There are little differences in how the phone operates that makes it so much better! I only wish iphones took memory cards because I'm a mom that is constantly taking pics of my babies and I have had to transfer quite a few pics to my computer already.. It'd be nice to not have to do that as often.. I'm glad I didnt go with the 8GB or I'd be transferring pictures every week!! \n It's really new condition. \n Perfect replacement for for the one my daughter broke. \n It was a gift, since I didn't have any complaints then it works perfectly. \n The phone\u200b is in such good condition I could have sworn it was brand new, if not for two very small scratches on the front glass.",

        "REVIEW": "Good deal. It came with all its accessories \n My daughter loves it so far \n The phone works perfectly but has a major flaw, FIRST, it doesnt have a SIM card, so i took it to verizon, they said no , i took it to t-mobile, they said no , took it to sprint, they said no, so, really it doesnt work for any carrier. \n Got this for my daughter as she trashed her previous one. Didn't know what to think from all the negative reviews about buying refurbished phones but figured I had to commit. Phone was delivered promptly and my daughter loves it. \n It is in perfect condition. We just missed the headphones. \n This iPhone frequently overheats.  I bought a protective case and the phone made the back of it bubble from the heat.  Also, the left side appears to be separating from the front of the phone, since a sliver of light is visible between the edge of the left side and the face of the phone. \n At first I was very happy with this phone, but after a period of time, with the ensuing problems listed above, I am less than satisfied with this item. \n The phone was alright however within a week of purchase the charger was not working and phone is not holding charge for long periods of time. I was not very please with the phone. \n Just as advertised it works great and in great condition \n I have been disapointed with this phone. Not as intuitive as I would have hoped. and I find it opinionated as far as what it wants to run or use. I bought it for the security, that I now understand is not what it was anyhow. many of the functions rely on starting at the edge of the screen, hard to do with a protector. The biggest disappointment was that I payed for one day shipping and shipping took 4 days \n It came with very few hardly visible scratches on the back, completely functional. I am sending this phones to Venezuela for my family so I hope they work fine, which they should LOL. The charger is not the original Apple charger but works fine. So far I'm happy with my purchase. The price is obviously below the real but for a refurbished phone is very good. \n Hope works well!",

No problems \n My son *had* to have one of these as his first mobile--& the price was great--so I purchased a refurb for him & the same for myself--I keep up with what my young son is doing with the mobile, so I, myself, changed from Android to Apple, so I'd know how to use these things. We've had our for months now. They both arrived in *perfect* condition and have been working wonderfully. I didn't give 5 stars only because I didn't realize what a pain it would be to go from a big Android screen to this little one. When the larger-screen one doesn't cost a small fortune, I'll buy a couple of those. \n I ordered factory unlocked but I received T-Mobile locked phone and even it was not able to detect T-Mobile network. This shouldn't be good. I took Prime membership and every time, trying to return the product. This was not fair. \n I am facing some problem while starting the phone and today looks like it is not at all starting.

        "REVIEW": "After less than 2 months my screen stopped working. Never dropped and it's inside of a life proof case. \n I got this iPhone with scratches and dints. Is not a refurbished certified item by Apple. Very disappointed. \n Amazing Quality!!! \n It cames with all the accesories!! \n Amazing i'm happy with it. \n very nice like new \n Perfect. Only one very bad point : impossible to switch off the camera shutter noise. If anybody has a solution,  please tell me. \n TBH I am a little annoyed with my purchase of this phone this far, it's been less than a week. The charger the phone came with did not work with the phone. I tried plugging it into the wall outlet, my computer - nothing worked. I had the charger from my iPhone 5 which worked for 2 days, before I started getting a \"This cable is not authorized for use\" message (my charger is a legit Apple charger), and the phone died, so I had to go out and spend $25 on a new charger because I had no other option; I needed a phone, and wasn't sure if it was the phone jack or the actual charger that was the issue. The new charger has been working for 2 days, until a few minutes ago I started receiving the same message the cable is not authorized for use. Fortunately if I replug the cable it connects again..but that didn't work with the first 2 apple chargers I used for it so I am anticipating the problem will be ongoing. I will see how it goes as it said the description it comes with a 90-day warranty but I am a little pissed I spent so much for a phone that is having issues 5 days in. \n Has yellow tint around the screen \n The Iphone it supposed to be like new? \n It came w like four scratch and glass broken \n I will not recommend this item \n I  found other Iphone new better price \n Tnks anyway. \n Very good. \n Love it. \n Yes great phone",

        "REVIEW": "Great \n Had  a excellent experience  Thanks will use on line more \n The phone came in great condition. The only big issue that i have here is that the battery life is horrible! On a fully charged battery it lasts maybe 3 hours if im lucky. which ultimately sucks. I will probably have to buy a new battery for it. Other than that its good and the extended battery pack that I always have to keep on me is a downfall but its okay for now. \n LOOKS NEW, FEELS NEW MY  SIBLINGS LOVE IT, PERFECT SIZE FOR 12Yrs olds \n I bought this phone to use with Tracfone's Bring Your Own Phone program (upgrading from an iphone 4S) and it is working perfectly. I did have an issue with the sim card not working, so I did have to call Tracfone, but they immediately sent a free replacement despite the fact that I bought the sim card through Amazon. The new sim ward worked perfectly. Everything transferred and my new phone was activated within a couple hours. \n This phone looks brand new. There weren't any scratches or visible wear on it. It charged perfectly and the improved battery performance over the 4S is extremely impressive. I love the Siri upgrade and the fingerprint unlock option (which works perfectly). All in all, this phone is exactly what I wanted and this was the lowest priced 5S I could find anywhere. \n Excelente \n Very bad very bad. Totally used and scratch phone I returned this phone within a hour. \n its good, except that it gets heated after the usage of calls or browse the apps. \n otherwise, the phone is good for the amount paid. \n So far , it is great \n Very nice looking phone, but it angers me greatly on the fact that it's never unlocked like it says it is!!!

And TWO DAYS before the 90 day warranty expires. \n Delivered as promised \n Great product, I would have not known it was refurbished. It is small and handy, and has the latest APPs! I should keep it for a while! \n We got our phone this week and within a day the charger housing burnt out. The charger it came with actually made sparks and seems to have burnt out the charger housing to the phone. It now will not charge. Very disappointed as our 12 year old saved money to buy his fist phone and this is what happened to it. Now we have to go through the most likely painful process of filing a claim and returning everything. Jus glad we're still in the manufacturer's warranty period. \n We started having problem with battery loading charge so fast and taking longer to recharge. The front part is deteriorating too. \n As expected. \n Nice produc \n I was a little hesitant because of the other reviews but I literally got a new phone.

It was a Christmas gift for my son and he's still using it. \n It was good \n 100% \n I was a bit worried given the good price point of this product and the slightly mixed reviews. However, the phone came in great condition - no scratches or visible marks. I've had the phone for a couple of weeks and have had zero problems with functionality. I will update should anything change but so far I am very happy with my purchase. \n Would've given it 5 stars but the charger and the earphones wasn't included. The iPhone itself looks brand new! My moms very happy with her gift. \n My phone apparently was manufactured in Japan, therefore the camera shutter sounds aren't able to be shut off. Everything else works fine but this is annoying \n V.good \n The whole phone is really like a new one, while the edge of the touching screen sometimes is a little bit not so sensitive. Overall, the price for this phone is completely worthy. \n I was a little skeptical about purchasing a refurbished phone for my son, but because a new iPhone 5s would cost between $400 - $500, and a 6s would cost even more than that, I went this route.  To say the least, he and I could not be happier with the purchase.  The phone showed up on time, packaged very neatly and safely, and most importantly the phone works flawlessly and looks brand new.

        "REVIEW": "Very happy with the phone, fast delivery \n Only complaint is there's a pink tint on the lcd. \n The phone was in excellent condition and works great.  Very happy with it. \n Was not a GSM phone. \n So far so good, don't have any problem with the phone \n Dis coloration on top of the screen (yellowish). Big scratch on the back. Product description said it is like \"new\" and certified refurbished, seller needs to improve quality process to check these units. Needed this phone in urgency and now I have to look for another one. Not satisfied a tall \n I love everything about it! Good investment. \n Its ok. I thought the screen wouldnbe bigger. \n Don't waste your time! \n I have had 2 refurbished ones since February 14th.  The first one was Space Grey and it was ok.  It had a few knicks on the side, which was fine.  However, voice calls sounded like people were drowning in water.  And the battery life was terrible.  It also took terrible pictures with the flash on. \n I then ordered a gold one.  It was in perfect condition (or so I thought).  The camera shutter sound would not shut off, no matter what I did.  After nearly a month, the phone started glitching and clicking apps that I did not click and so forth.  I couldn't control what it was clicking.  I will be sending this one back today (it was from the seller BREED). \n Do yourself a favor and go out and buy a NEW iPhone!  You won't regret it. \n I was satisfied with my product. The only problem I had was the battery. I had to go get the battery replaced, but after it worked like a dream.",

        "REVIEW": "Works fine.  Im always buying one generation old phones to avoid contracts.  Mine die by being dropped on asphalt or in toilets.... \n The phone arrived broken. Screen has a huge pink cast on it. \n I'm loving my new iPhone. No wear or tear, especially for it being refurbished. Best mobile device I have ever owned! \n Phone was in excellent condtion, but there was no charger in the box, so sad... \n A really good product! The aparience was perfect! \n No marks, the best quality.. \n The phone they sent me doesn't work. I bough it to connect it in El Salvador and the phone stopped working after a few weeks. It started turning off and then it would go past the screen of the apple when you turn it on and the screen goes blue. Either its stolen or they replaced the screen with one that is not compatible with the phone. Now I cant return it and it is unfortunate I spent $255 for something that does not work. Piece of advice DO NOT BUY IPHONES OF AMAZON. \n Wouldn't recommend. I bought mine after the screen shattered on my original one (at a similar condition as this one). I was very disappointed. My phone randomly freezes when texts are coming in and it took me over a month to notice it was because of the phone. I have to restart it every time to make it work again. \n Very pleased with my purchase and the excellent service provided. \n Arrived on time and works great on GSM (T Mobile and Metro) networks. Metro easily inserted their required SIM card when I signed up for service. Was advertised as SILVER but came in WHITE-which was my preference anyway, (had to deduct one star for that).  Phone was clean, no scratches and works well. Price was reasonable for this phone. I would purchase from this seller again. \n Very nice. I got a new iPhone and charger only thing missing is the earphones but it's sooo nice thanks much.",

        "REVIEW": "Excellent phone for a Christmas present.My granddaughter loved the 5S iPhone. \n I'm really happy with my IPhone, it looks brand new! I got It on time.I was really nervous because it had a sticker on the back saying it was Verizon, but it turned out that it was really unlocked for GSM carriers. The chargers I got are not apple products but that's fine, they still work great! \n I ordered this iPhone expecting it to be as the description said: only compatible with GSM carriers such as AT&T and T Mobile, not non-GSM carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, etc. Yet the first words I read on the sticker as I took it out of its box was Verizon Carrier. \n Also, I ordered an unused, new refurbished iPhone, but it came in a plastic baggie inside a small, cardboard box. Nice going. That sucker was totally used. \n This phone looks and acts brand new. Delivered right on time, with specified recharger. I'm giving it only four stars because although it was really unlocked as described on the website, it arrived with a sticker on the back designating it as a Verizon phone. The seller could not be reached, as it was a Saturday, and Amazon customer service could not provide any more info. When I took it to my service provider of choice (not Verizon), there was no problem. It was unlocked. Just carelessness on the sellers part. It's a great phone at a good price. Just don't get nervous if you get the sticker. \n My phone came with no headphone nor does it have the apple box and it was a little crack on the back of the phone. The front was okay but have a little scratch. I'm pretty disappointed but overall the phone work great \n Great seller, great phone ! \n Excellent product, it works like new. Totally recommended. \n I love it! Works perfectly!! \n Missing charger and cable that was supposed to be part of my purchase. \n I was pleased with what i got , it came on time and shipped perfect but the only thing is that it had a scratch or 2 on the edge but besides that the phone is perfect. Also the phone died and it takes long to charge or maybe the charger doesnt work ? But overall its pretty good",

I am highly satisfied with my purchase. \n The iPhone was in good condition however the charging cable did not work. The products are supposed to be checked before being sent to the customer.

        "REVIEW": "Certified Refurbished my butt! This product came looking perfect and I was super excited for it! I have had a crappy Galaxy 3 for a while and it just stopped working so I finally decided to move on up in the world! Take the phone and start using it, and it seems great! I realize it's low on battery so I go to plug it in. I come back a couple minutes later realize it is losing battery even as it charges! So now I have a phone that can't charge. I feel like if this was a \"certified\" refurbish checking to make sure the battery still worked would probably be the first thing I check! Extremely disappointed in the product! I do not recommend! \n Looked great and was not an issue to put it on my Metro PCS plan. \n Honestly zero problems with this phone. Works with no flaws, came with no scratches, and had it activated and working within a day of receiving it. I've seen other reviews saying they had problems with it being listed as stolen or it coming scratched/damaged, but, at least in my case, you could never tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one. \n THIS IS THE PHONE YOULL WANT TO BUY!!!!! I absolutely love this phone it was basically like a brand new phone when I got it, there were no scratches or scrapes, the screen was perfect and absolutely no damages upon its arrival. It came three days earlier than the arrival date that was set, I love the phone it's been working just fine I've had zero problems since the day I got it. If you're looking for a good phone and person to buy it from you are definitely in the right place. \n Just got the phone today so I will update review if any problems occur, so far so good. Only noticed my phone got hot for a few seconds while I was using it. Really hope this doesn't cause me problems because it really looks BRAND NEW and I would hate to have to return it. Wasn't expecting headphones because of other reviews I read but I received brand new ones as well as a charger. \n Ok \n Phone arrived ahead of schedule and looked immaculate.  Works great and all is well \n Like new condition.  Gave it as a gift - he loves it.

        "REVIEW": "Just bought them for my friend. The packing is excellent. It comes with charger and cable \n It's great and works like it's brand new. \n My IPhone 5s arrived on time and appeared to be in very good condition. No scratches or dings. I tried to power up and got no response. I plugged it into the new charging unit and still nothing that would indicate life. After 5 minutes on the charger the battery condition gauge finally appears and shows it's completely discharged. I let it charge for an hour and when I checked it there was no change. \n The gauge showed that charging was taking place but there was no increase in battery power. \n I took the phone to the Apple Store and had it checked. The phone was fine in all respects and just over a year old according to the serial number but the battery was totally dead and needed replaced. \n I was leaving on an extended vacation to Thailand in 3 days so my only option was to have the battery replaced for $84. Tax included. \n Very disappointed that the seller would send a supposed \"refurbished\" phone with a dead battery that can't be charged and call it good and in working condition. \n BUYER BEWARE!!! I won't take a second chance with them. \n Great phone! Thanks! \n Mya daughter absolutely loves it, no problems and no hassles. \n looks like brand new iphone. Even with its plastic protectors both front and back. \n Shipment took more than 1 week, but besides that everything was perfect. \n Yes I Akhaddt by phone case is very good now, I asked for the phone once again I hope to have a good Aldhan once again \n The phone is not unlocked.

        "REVIEW": "Works good don't have any issue came on time and they actually asked for signature ringed my door bell. I'll recommend this iPhone. \n The phone does Not Work. And it is not factory unlocked .it' s a fraud!!!!!! \n Disappointment. Arrived with a terrible package, with no charger cable or earphones and a bended chassis with major scratches on every side of the phone. Battery is giving different percantages and vibration motor is operating improperly. Screen is not fit on its chassis and more. It is clear that this cannot be a CERTIFIED REFURBISHED but it is a very bad damaged SELLER REFURBISHED which is fixed by an unexperienced person. I have no chance to turn it back and i think it is my fate. I have to use it after some repairs. \n Thank you FULLFILED SELLER. :( \n My iPhone will not hold a charge. I hard started it, changed out the cables, changed out outlets and all types of combinations. \n Excellent product! \n Everything ok \n This phone, although in great condition, was flagged as a stolen phone when I tried to activate it with my provider.  Returned it. \n Perfect \n It was in perfect New condition without any scratches.. \n It has some big scratches and the usb cable is of bad quality",

        "REVIEW": "All perfect! I LOVE IT! All excellent, good choice. \n Awesome so far. My first iphone. I almost returned it because I saw all these thumb prints on the glass which makes it feel so used but then I realized it was just the screen protector. Peeled it right off and it looks brand new.  Also, my iphone didn't come with any other accessories except the charger. \n Works perfectly. Great refurb for my wife. \n So far so good, no issues, quick delivery. \n Excellent value - perfect condition.  Love my iPhone 5s! \n bought this for my wife, it arrived when expected, looks and functions as new. my wife had no trouble setting it up with straight talk, and she loves the phone more than her old 4s, which she was really pleased with. \n It's fine \n Great phone \n Until now, working perfectly, looks very good \n The usb cable is not certified  so doesn't work....",

        "REVIEW": "Order the I phone 5 s refurbished and was very happy with it!! Could not tell it was even a refurbished one would definitely recommend this \n The phone looks great and all is well, but the battery is horrible! The battery loses >10% every hour when the phone is OFF! If I would stay on my phone for a hour, I'd be at less then 5% battery left! & that doesnt even compare for how slow it charges. I am conpletely upset and sad that my 90 day warranty is off and I have to live with this crucial battery. \n Phone did not work! Very disappointed! Sent it back and now I have no phone! \n yep \n I have been using the phone for about a week and I haven't had anything wrong with it. I looks Brand New.. There wasn't any thing on it and was a box and had a charger and adapter with it. Everything was really good! \n The phone seemed nice, but after a day of use it started turning off and sometimes even freezing for no reason. It kept going so I had to returned, I just sent it back and I'm waiting for my money I guess it will be on my account in a week or so (hopefully). \n Phone works great.  Had a little snag with getting it set up properly with Tracfone, but the seller was very accommodating during the process and was willing to take it back if things did not work out.  Kudos to them.  It worked out fine though. \n First things first, this phone is top-notch for the price listed. Although, I was in bad luck of my sim tray not working but I contacted the customer service and I was set. The phone looks perfectly new ; no scratches, scruffs, etc. When you see the word \" refurbished \" on the title when buying this, it certainly is refurbished. The flash is so easy to catch, and it's so dull and fake, it seems like a rainbow whilst taking a picture. The camera aren't certainly the worst, especially the front-facing camera. The front-facing camera gets me so hesitated, I, sometimes feel like breaking and cracking this phone open. Nonetheless, this phone is top-notch for the time being. READ THIS REVIEW FAST YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS IT! \n IT'S A MUST BUY TOO FOR THE PRICE LISTED. \n Arrived on time and was in basically brand new shape. I am thrilled with my purchase. Works and looks great. The only thing I did not like was that the accessories that came with it (charger, box) are not actually made by Apple. Otherwise I would highly recommend. \n shipped on time, in one piece, and it works",

        "REVIEW": "Oh yeah! It works very good as I expected... Thank you! \n The iPhone 5s silver turned out to be locked.  However, we were able to get it unlocked at no cost, and not too much time involvement. \n the phone was like brand new no scuffs scratches or nothing good phone I recamend you people to buy this it is worth it promise. \n It didnt brought earphones... \n Love this phone. The only issue I have had is my phone screen starts acting crazy when you're charging it and it's around 80%. Apparently this is a common issue that iPhones have when you're charging them with a charger that's not officially apple. So that saying, if you get a charger from this order, it's most likely not apple. \n Good product. Works well. \n Iam totally upset of i phone which sent to me . Side broken no headset no mannual not even i phone cover . On 22 of sep iam going home india ... details i ll sent from there \n Right now is not working....i want reimbursement. ..looking forward. .... \n It works fine just rarely it freezes on certain apps I don't know why and it had a few scratches on the back but other than that I'm satisfied. \n this came perfect and it works overseas, i am in the uk and ordered it from the us and it works perfectly with a gsm carrier, must be one luckily i have that i would buy again if needed",

        "REVIEW": "Phone works OK, but charging cable did not work.  Had to purchase another cable. \n I bought 5S Gold 16GB last week and came back Brasil. It has some scratch on the frame upper but it's ok. But problem is IPhone is not working in Brasil even though it is unlocked. I contact apple support they infom me of that it is locked so I have to contact carrier Mecury mobile in US directly. What happen???? There is no way?? \n All good \n Yes, it did meet my expectations.  It looks like new and mostly works great.  Do have one problem that involved a text address showing up as a different number and not getting send.  I guess I need to take it to the apple store and see what the trouble is. \n It didn't work. \n I got a phone with the following problems: \n At the top of the phone dent 1/8 inch, on the side of the phone a lot of scratches. During charging, the phone is overheating. When using headphones, you hear noise and crackling. Twice, during a call, the phone was switched off. \n Iphone 5s gold 16gb with 2 little scratches on back. Right now its functioning properly and everything looks good. But it came in a duplicate iphone box. Okay. \n Confusing to set up \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude12 \n I have ordered this phone which is a certified refurbished. But I'm facing the following issues with the phone. \n 1) The Home button is very hard. \n 2) when ever I connect the Lightening USB cable to my phone, Phone is getting heated up in such a way that we can't even hold the phone in hands. \n 3) I think the USB lightening cable is not an Original cable. \n I have fully observed the phone for one day and I'm writing this review. \n I wanna kno if it comes with a chager and headphones or just the iPhone i also wanna kno if it comes in its box",
